1.  **Compare more than two Note documents**
    
    Starting from version 20.2 GroupDocs.Comparison allows to compare more than two OneNote documents ( Microsoft OneNote documents for creating and exchanging notes) this functionality works for .one files
    
    Following code snippet shows how to do this, here we are comparing 3 Note files
    
    ```csharp
    string sourcePath = "source.one";
    string target1Path = "target1.one";
    string target2Path = "target2.one";
    string target3Path = "target3.one";
    string resultPath = "result.one";
     
    Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath);
    comparer.Add(target1Path);
    comparer.Add(target2Path);
    comparer.Add(target3Path);
     
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(resultPath), new SaveOptions(), new CompareOptions());
    ```
    
2.  **Compare more than two SpreadSheet documents**
    
    Starting from version 20.2 GroupDocs.Comparison allows to compare more than two SpreadSheed documents (including spreadsheet file format created by Microsoft for use with Microsoft Excel, and ODS  - spreadsheet file format used by OpenOffice/StarOffice).
    
    This functionality works for "xls", "xlsx", "xlsb", "csv", "ods", "xls2003", "xlsm" files
    
    Following code snippet shows how to do this, here we are comparing 3 Excell files
    
    ```csharp
    string sourcePath = "source.xlsx";
    string target1Path = "target1.xlsx";
    string target2Path = "target2.xlsx";
    string target3Path = "target3.xlsx";
    string resultPath = "result.pdf";
     
    Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath);
    comparer.Add(target1Path);
    comparer.Add(target2Path);
    comparer.Add(target3Path);
     
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(resultPath), new SaveOptions(), new CompareOptions());
    ```
