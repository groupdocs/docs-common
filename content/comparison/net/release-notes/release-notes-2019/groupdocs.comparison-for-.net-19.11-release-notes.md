1.  **Multicomparing for Email documents**  
    You have ability to compare more than one target email (eml) documents.
    
    ```csharp
    string sourcePath = "source.eml";
    string target1Path = "target1.eml";
    string target2Path = "target2.eml";
    string target3Path = "target3.eml";
    string resultPath = "result.eml";
     
     
    Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath);
    comparer.Add(target1Path);
    comparer.Add(target2Path);
    comparer.Add(target3Path);
     
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(resultPath), new SaveOptions(), new CompareOptions());
    ```
    
2.  **Multicomparing for Text documents**  
    You have ability to compare more than one target text files.
    
    ```csharp
    string sourcePath = "source.txt";
    string target1Path = "target1.txt";
    string target2Path = "target2.txt";
    string target3Path = "target3.txt";
    string resultPath = "result.txt";
     
     
    Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath);
    comparer.Add(target1Path);
    comparer.Add(target2Path);
    comparer.Add(target3Path);
     
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(resultPath), new SaveOptions(), new CompareOptions());
    ```
    
3.  **Option that allows to set output format of document (paper size)**  
    
    There was  added  a new ability to adjust the paper size of the result document.
    
    A new *PaperSize *propertywas added  to CompareOptions. User can set the output document paper size by assigning this property the value from the *PaperSize* enum.
    
    If user doesn’t set *PaperSize*, it has a default value - paper size in the resulting document is the same as in the target.
    
    ```csharp
    string sourcePath = "source.docx";
    string targetPath = "target.docx";
    string resultPath = "result.docx";
     
    CompareOptions compareOptions = new CompareOptions();
    compareOptions.PaperSize = PaperSize.A4;
     
    Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath);
    comparer.Add(targetPath);
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(resultPath), new SaveOptions(), compareOptions);
    ```
    
4.  **Option to switch header/footer comparison**  
    
    There was added a new option to compare header and footer of documents you could set it using *HeaderFootersComparison* property in *CompareOptions*
    
    By default, this property is true. To ignore the comparison of headers and footers, you should set it to false.
    
    ```csharp
    string sourcePath = "source.pdf";
    string targetPath = "target.pdf";
    string resultPath = "source.pdf";
     
    //do not compare header/footer
    CompareOptions compareOptions = new CompareOptions();
    compareOptions.HeaderFootersComparison = false;
     
    Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath);
    comparer.Add(targetPath);
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(resultPath), new SaveOptions(), compareOptions);
    ```
