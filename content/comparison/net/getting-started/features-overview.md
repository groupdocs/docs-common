# File comparison

**[GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/net)** provides an ability to detect differences between source and target files for changes at paragraphs, words and characters levels. Can identify styling and formatting changes - like bold, italic, underlines, strike-troughs, font types, etc.

## Apply/Reject changes between documents

Every particular difference between compared document can be applied or rejected and the exported to a final document.

## Document information extraction

GroupDocs.Comparison allows to obtain basic information about source document - file type, size, pages count etc.  
This may be quite useful for generating previews of compared documents.

## Comparison summary report

 Once comparison process is complete, you can save a differences summary report which lists all changes found between compared documents.
