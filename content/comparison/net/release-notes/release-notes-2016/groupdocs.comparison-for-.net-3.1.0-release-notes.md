### Common operations with automatic file format detection

#### Compare documents from strings.

NOTE: Assuming there are files in source.docx, source.xlsx, source.pdf, source.pptx, source.txt are in the same folder as executing assembly.

**C#**

```csharp
string sourcePath = @"./data/source.docx";
string targetPath = @"./data/target.docx";

Comparison comparison = new Comparison();
Stream result = comparison.Compare(sourcePath, targetPath);

```

#### Compare documents from strings with result path.

**C#**

```csharp
 string sourcePath = @"./data/source.docx";
 string targetPath = @"./data/target.docx";

Comparison comparison = new Comparison();
Stream result = comparison.Compare(sourcePath, targetPath, resultPath);

```

#### Compare documents from strings with result path and target extension.

**C#**

```csharp
string sourcePath = @"./data/source.docx";
 string targetPath = @"./data/target.docx";


Comparison comparison = new Comparison();
Stream result = comparison.Compare(sourcePath, targetPath, resultPath, FileType.Docx);

```

#### Compare documents from strings with result path and settings.

**C#**

```csharp
string sourcePath = @"./data/source.docx";
