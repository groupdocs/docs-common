# Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

#### New property in WordProcessingEditOptions

Implementing a EDITORNET-1467 ticket has a result in form of a new public property in the `GroupDocs.Editor.Options.WordProcessingEditOptions` class:

```csharp
public string InputControlsClassName {get; set;}
```

You can find more info about this feature in the article "[Adding class name to input controls]({{< ref "editor/net/developer-guide/advanced-usage/working-with-wordprocessing-documents/adding-class-name-to-input-controls.md" >}})".

#### New enum and property in TextEditOptions

Implementing a EDITORNET-1512 ticket caused a new enum `GroupDocs.Editor.Options.TextDirection`:

```csharp
public enum TextDirection
{
	LeftToRight,
	RightToLeft,
	Auto
}
```

This enum is now used in the `GroupDocs.Editor.Options.TextEditOptions` class:

```csharp
public TextDirection Direction {get; set;}
```

#### New enum value in PdfCompliance enum

The EDITORNET-1505 improvement is represented by a new value in the `GroupDocs.Editor.Options.PdfCompliance`:

```csharp
public enum PdfCompliance
{
	...
	Pdf17,
	...
}
```
